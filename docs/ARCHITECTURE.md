## Ownership boundaries

- The skill chooses when an artifact is appropriate, routes one of the two workspace-evidence flows, retains an exact request/workspace-to-handle mapping, writes complete Markdown, answers review questions in chat, and reacts to decisions.
- The MCP server resolves current workspace candidates grouped by live VS Code window, exclusively creates schema-v5 artifacts in global storage, commits schema-v1 window-routing requests, and advances review rounds. It generates IDs and review sessions, validates paths and selection grants, owns transient waiter registration, issues one-time round tokens, and commits round transitions transactionally.
- Each extension host window publishes fresh canonical workspace roots plus its stable instance ID, focus hint, and active-file context. It validates connection targets and artifact bindings, opens only requests addressed to its own instance ID, and writes user comments/submissions.
- The webview renders sanitized CommonMark/GFM and sends typed messages to the extension host. It has no direct filesystem or process access.
- `src/shared` is the single contract boundary used by the MCP, extension host, and webview.

## Lifetime model

```text
artifact lifetime > waiter lifetime > chat-turn lifetime
```

An artifact is persistent per-user data associated with a target workspace. A waiter is an in-memory connection from one MCP request to one exact artifact round. A chat turn may end or interrupt that request without changing the artifact.

Cancellation and takeover alone close watchers/timers and release waiter ownership only. They do not edit `artifact.json`, `artifact.md`, `comments.json`, `review-submission.json`, or `artifact-connection.json`; only an explicit reconnect intent may commit new routing state during inspection. MCP restart loses active waiters and tokens, but a validated inspection can issue a fresh token from the persistent schema-v5 state.

## Lifecycle tools

1. `resolve_artifact_workspace` runs before any target-workspace action for creation without a tagged file and is the only MCP tool allowed before the agent reads the artifact contract. It normalizes common separators and searches every fresh workspace snapshot by the user's exact keyword/path. Results preserve window groups (`windowInstanceId`, focus hint, snapshot context, and folders). If the registry contains one folder overall, MCP returns it as `matched`/`single-folder` even when the text differs. A query with no match returns all fresh folders grouped by window with `matchMode: "all-available"`; an empty fresh registry returns `not-found`. Focus affects ordering only. Every candidate has an opaque selection token bound to its exact window/workspace tuple. The resolver never creates anything; the skill chooses one unique strongest candidate across groups or asks only when the strongest targets remain tied. Once one folder is chosen, the agent reads the contract before inspecting that folder or calling any lifecycle tool.
2. `create_artifact` validates either tagged-file evidence or a `resolved-workspace` grant, selects one live window containing the validated workspace, creates review round 1, commits connection revision 1, and immediately returns the exact handle plus connection metadata. A tagged-file request with multiple eligible windows fails before mutation with `WINDOW_SELECTION_REQUIRED`; retry uses `connection.selectionToken` while the tagged file remains ownership evidence. The official skill always sends `kind: "implementation-plan"`.
3. `wait_for_artifact_review` attaches the single waiter for an expected round or immediately returns an existing submission.
4. `inspect_artifact_review` reads the current manifest, Markdown, comments, optional submission, connection state, and hashes. With `intent: "reconnect"`, it revalidates a live target against the manifest workspace and atomically increments the connection revision with a new open-request ID; a window ID is only a hint, while ambiguous candidates require `connection.selectionToken`. With `takeover: true`, inspection first aborts and drains the prior waiter. It can grant a token from saved comments even before submission, or a chat-update token on an empty round when `intent: "explicit-chat-update"` is supplied.
5. `advance_and_wait_for_artifact` consumes an exact-state round token, optionally replaces Markdown, advances the round, resets comments/submission, and attaches a waiter for the new round. Omitting Markdown preserves its exact bytes and SHA. Both wait and advance preserve existing connection state and cannot rebind the artifact.

The default flow is create -> wait -> submitted decision. Review (`revise`) grants a round token and uses the same feedback policy as chat inspection: answer questions visibly in chat, replace Markdown only for requested changes, then advance and wait. Question-only Review preserves the current Markdown bytes/SHA. Proceed (`approve`) and Just save (`save`) end only the current round and do not automatically advance. For `plan` and `implementation-plan`, the Proceed result additionally carries `nextAction.type: "execute-approved-plan"`; this is runtime authorization to execute all approved in-scope actions immediately in the same turn. Every lifecycle result includes an RFC 8089 `artifactUrl` and regular Markdown `artifactLink`; neither is a custom-editor deep link.

The chat-escape flow differs only in transport: it cancels the live waiter and inspects the exact retained handle instead of receiving a Review submission. Classification, chat answers, optional Markdown replacement, clarification, advancement, and waiting behavior are shared with Review. If no feedback exists, the skill reattaches to the same round unless the user explicitly requested edits in chat (via `intent: "explicit-chat-update"`). Reconnecting an already approved or saved artifact is explicit and must not repeat the prior command.

Only one waiter may own an artifact. Round tokens are in-memory, single-use, expire after one hour, and bind the artifact, session, round, artifact hash, comments hash, and submission presence/hash. Tokens have sources `submitted-review`, `chat-inspection`, or `chat-update` (which requires replacement Markdown with a different SHA). A token is consumed only after a successful transaction commit. Lifecycle errors retain readable text and add typed recovery metadata (`code`, retryability, next-tool hint, token reuse, same-handle requirement, and optional current round), preventing blind replay when commit state is uncertain.

## Persistent protocol

Schema v5 is the sole live lifecycle protocol:

- `artifact.json` identifies the schema-v5 artifact, `location.workspaceRoot`, session, and current round.
- `artifact.md` contains the complete current document.
- `comments.json` contains saved comments bound to the current round and artifact hash.
- `review-submission.json` appears after Review, Proceed, or Just save.
- `artifact-connection.json` is optional schema-v1 UI-routing state containing only `windowInstanceId`, `connectionRevision`, `openRequestId`, `source`, and `updatedAt`.

Advancing always increments the round and resets handled comments. A question-only advance uses the existing Markdown unchanged. Schemas v3/v4 are rejected and are not live-migrated.

`artifact.json` remains the source of truth for artifact ID and `location.workspaceRoot`; connection state never duplicates or overrides them. Connection revisions start at 1 and increment once per successful create/reconnect commit under an artifact-scoped lock. Revisions provide ordering and diagnostics, while unique open-request IDs deduplicate filesystem events. Connection writes are atomic and do not change Markdown bytes/SHA, comments, submission, review round, or round tokens.

## Workspace registry

Each running extension window writes an atomic snapshot under `~/.ai-artifacts/managed/workspaces/` (or `CODEX_ARTIFACTS_REGISTRY_DIRECTORY`) and refreshes it every 15 seconds. Schema-v2 snapshots expire after 45 seconds and contain canonical workspace folders, focus state, and the active file/root when available.

Creation accepts exactly two typed evidence variants. `tagged-file` proves ownership through an existing user-tagged file contained by the registered root. Without a tagged file, `resolve_artifact_workspace` runs before project-file reads or artifact drafting. It matches separator-normalized user words against fresh folders while preserving each window group. A registry with one folder overall is intrinsically unambiguous and returns `single-folder`; otherwise no-match candidates remain grouped as `available`. `resolved-workspace` proves the chosen candidate came from that resolver call through a ten-minute, window/workspace-bound, single-use token. Focus is only a ranking hint. The skill may choose a uniquely strongest candidate from the returned name, path, match classification, and user wording; it asks the user only when no unique high-confidence target exists. Tagged-file creation keeps the tagged file as ownership evidence and uses a separate connection token only when identical workspace roots need window disambiguation. Only then may the skill read the chosen folder. Later lifecycle calls use only the exact artifact handle; they never call the resolver or infer “latest artifact” from cwd or a workspace scan.

## Filesystem safety

- Artifact IDs are generated by the server and directories are created exclusively as direct children of `~/.ai-artifacts/artifacts/`.
- The exact global handle is canonicalized and bound to the manifest artifact ID. Nested, escaped, linked, workspace-local, and wrong-home paths are rejected before read or mutation.
- On POSIX, managed directories are tightened to owner-only `0700` and lifecycle files to `0600`. Windows relies on the user account and filesystem ACLs and makes no POSIX-mode guarantee.
- Canonical containment is checked before mutation; linked artifact storage paths are rejected.
- Create rollback may remove only the exact newly allocated directory.
- Advance stages the next round and restores prior files if commit fails. A narrow in-place fallback handles Windows editor locks.
- Installer cleanup recognizes only extension-managed MCP blocks, hook entries, scripts, runtime files under `~/.ai-artifacts/managed/`, legacy `~/.vscode/ai-artifacts/` assets, registry snapshots, and managed skill directories. Unrelated user configuration is preserved, and user review data in `~/.ai-artifacts/artifacts/` is retained on uninstall.

## Extension watcher and editor opening

The extension validates and creates the global collection root before registering a `RelativePattern` watcher for direct-child `artifact-connection.json` creation and change. Every extension window receives the filesystem event, performs bounded retry for transient create/replace races, and revalidates the root, artifact directory, connection file, manifest binding, and linked-path safety on every read attempt. A window ignores the request unless `connection.windowInstanceId` matches its own stable instance ID. The matching window may call `vscode.openWith` even when unfocused, provided `agentPlus.autoOpenArtifactReview` is enabled. Disabling auto-open does not prevent MCP from committing routing state.

Each window deduplicates successfully handled `openRequestId` values and coalesces concurrent work by canonical artifact path. Failed opens are not permanently deduplicated, so a later event can retry. Different artifacts remain independent, and VS Code's single-editor-per-document contract performs the final reuse/reveal behavior. Non-target validation failures remain silent in that window; the target window reports actionable failures without opening an unsafe artifact.

The manual **AI Artifacts: Open Artifact Review** command uses the active Artifact Review URI when available or a file picker rooted at the global collection. It shares the same validation and open coordinator as the watcher. A chat `artifactLink` is only a regular file link and may open a normal Markdown editor depending on the client.

## Deployment and filesystem support

The supported v1.0.0 topology requires a local desktop VS Code-compatible extension host and MCP process running as the same OS user, resolving the same home, and seeing the same `~/.ai-artifacts/` filesystem. Windows, macOS, and Linux are the declared local targets. Remote SSH, WSL, dev containers, Codespaces, browser/virtual workspaces, and split-host topologies are unsupported in v1.0.0 because their producer/consumer filesystem boundary has not passed the release matrix.

## Compatibility

Extension version 1.0.0 ships MCP server 8.0.0, artifact schema v5, and optional connection schema v1 as a hard compatibility cutoff. The MCP tool catalog remains exactly five tools, but grouped resolver responses and reconnect routing are not compatible with the older MCP 7/skill contract. Schema-v3/v4 and workspace-local lifecycles remain untouched on disk but are not parsed, opened, advanced, or migrated. Updating the extension does not mutate an already installed runtime or skill; users must reinstall integrations, restart the AI client, and start a fresh chat. Rolling back the extension likewise requires reinstalling the matching older runtime/skill. Optional connection files are retained as user artifact data and may be ignored by older code; they are never deleted during rollback or uninstall.
